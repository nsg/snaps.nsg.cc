# Introduction

This page contains a list snaps that I manage at [snapcraft.io](https://snapcraft.io). Snaps are a package format commonly used on Ubuntu systems but they work on a large flavor of Linux distributions like Debian, Fedora and some embedded systems. Canonical is the backing organization behind snaps and they originated from the now canceled Ubuntu Phone project.

You can read more about snaps at the official site at [https://snapcraft.io](https://snapcraft.io)
