# Introduction

This page contains a list snaps that I manage at [snapcraft.io](https://snapcraft.io). Snaps are a package format commonly used on Ubuntu systems but they work on a large flavor of Linux distributions like Debian, Fedora and some embedded systems. Canonical is the backing organization behind snaps and they originated from the now canceled Ubuntu Phone project.

You can read more about snaps at the official site at [https://snapcraft.io](https://snapcraft.io)

## My snaps

### Maintained snaps

This is a list of snaps that I consider maintained. If you like to to change anything, like update to a newer version feel free to add a issue or open a pull request with the changes.

#### [graphpath](/graphpath)

It can be useful if you like to see an ASCII network diagram of your routing table.

#### [springlobby-nsg](/springlobby-nsg)

Spring Lobby is a project to manage games built around the game engine Spring RTS. The lobby from the repositories are usually to old to connect to the official servers, this solves that.

#### [konstructs-client](/konstructs-client)

A few years back I made a Minecraft inspired game with [a friend](https://github.com/carelfaber). It was fun but the project is more or less canceled due lack of time.

#### [tunnel](/tunnel)

Snap to quickly setup a network layer 2 tunnel between point A and point B.

### Old snaps

Old snaps that are not maintained anymore.

#### minecraft-nsg

I made this to easily install Minecraft, since then Mojang has published real deb-packages with an native installer. This snap has been forked and lives on as [mc-installer](https://snapcraft.io/mc-installer).

#### Other

I also have clion-nsg, homeassistant-nsg, homer-nsg and outline in the store. I control the konstructs name.
